# General Service App

A WordPress plugin for installing adding a newsfeed from the [General Service App](https://generalservice.app)

```
[general_service_app]
[general_service_app language="es"]
```

## To Do

- [ ] Pass entity id (right now Area 06 is hard-coded)
- [ ] Get feed just for an Area (right now it loads a District's feed)
